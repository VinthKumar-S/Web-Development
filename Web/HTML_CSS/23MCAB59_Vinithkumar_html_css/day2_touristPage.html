        Ooty Lake is an artificial lake constructed by John Sullivan in <del>1823</del><ins>1824</ins>. 
        The water flowing down mountain streams in the Ooty valley was dammed to form the lake. 
        The lake became empty on three occasions when it breached its bund. Originally, the lake was intended to be used for fishing, with ferries being used to travel across the lake. It gradually shrunk from its original size, giving place to the current bus stand, race course and the lake park. The Tamil Nadu Tourism Development Corporation, on behalf of the Tourism Department,
         took possession of the lake in 1973 to provide boating facilities as a tourist attraction
